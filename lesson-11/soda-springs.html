        <article><h3>NOAA Warns Residents for Possible Landslide</h3>
        <img class="imgright" src="images/heavyrain.jpg" alt="mountain climbing with dog" width="500" height="333">
        <div class="p"><p>National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration warns residents to be on alert for the overflowing of the dikes and river flooding as unprecedented pouring continued to play havoc with the lives of the people in the city. Landslides are also expected in the slopes and mountainous areas in the western, eastern, and northern areas. While torrential rain spreads across the southern part, the stationary front remains for days. </p>
            <p>Flashflood occurred in some areas of Anodjud town, on the 28th of November marked its heaviest rainfall of the season. No casualties have been reported, but vigilance and preparations have been set by the government in case the heavy rains continue. The neighboring cities, Panukadpa and Landolumos, were also stricken with seven-hour precipitation total marked the highest on record. </p>
             <p>In addition, Dag-Umaoy town in Nampa also recorded 80.4 millimeters of rain for 3 hours, breaking its records for November. On November 29, at 9:15 a.m., landslide warnings were issued for the 80 towns and cities. Some areas had more than 990 mm in total precipitation since it began raining. The front is expected to remain stationary through the end of November, possibly worsening rainfall totals further. Anticipation of possible risk is high, urging residents to prepare their 72-hour kits and evacuation bags all the time. </p>
            <p>The highest precipitation expected in each region for the 24 hours through 6 a.m. on November 29 is 100 to 200 mm in the Priestriver and Kuna cities; 100 to 150 mm in the Lapwai, Hayden, Pocatello, and garden cities; and 50 to 100 mm in the Rexburg, Spirit Lake, and Weston cities. </p>
            <p>According to the tally compiled by NOAA, there were seven deaths associated with heavy rains that began from Aug. 11 in Nagano, Nagasaki, and Saga prefectures. </p>
            <p>In Winchester, an old couple and three children in a house were buried in a landslide from a mountain on the morning of November 26. Four people were reported missing in the two towns of Boise, Oakley, and Aberdeen. Residents are encouraged to constantly tune in for warnings through Klimagator updates. </p>
