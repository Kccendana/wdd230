                    <li><p>A group of teenagers went for a trip in the mountain and lost track of their way home. They determined KlimaGator geocoding location information and found access to a safety travel/transportation scheme. They could not believe a weather forecast site could help them find their way home.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>An athlete decided to take a run in the outback and checked the safety weather for a run. He didn't have access to KlimaGator, but his outdated mobile phone had free-dial access to keep up with the weather forecast during that day. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>An American businessman is planning a trip to Osaka, Japan, to meet with business partners. The urgency of the meeting cut short his plan into a week. He heard a super typhoon hitting Osaka with landfall time the same day he wished to go. He took out his laptop and inquired KlimaGator for safety options to save the day for his business trip.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>A group of doctors decided to provide a 3-day covid vaccination in an open area on a first-come-first-served basis. They offered reservations via the link provided for the public and encouraged everyone to use the link access of KlimaGator to see the weather conditions. The aspirants were guided with the safety travel/ transportation schemes and informed to prepare umbrellas or raincoats according to the weather forecast. They received an update on the weather of the vaccination days.</p>

                        <p>The Local Athletic committee decided to pursue a 5-day athletic meet highlighting the final and championship relays on the fifth day. The chairperson refers to KlimaGator for the best weather options with five consecutive fine days within two weeks of available weather forecasts. They decided to adjust the starting day earlier than planned after knowing that the final day had heavy rainfall. Thanks to KlimaGator.</p>
